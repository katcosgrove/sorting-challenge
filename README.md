# Data Display and Sort

A small Vue.js app that consumes an API and displays response data in an easily-consumable and organized way.

Table data is sortable by clicking table headers. By default, data is sorted by project name. To view more detailed information on a particular entry, click its row. As the amount of data coming back from the API is quite large, I opted to include pagination.
